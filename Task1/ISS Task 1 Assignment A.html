        <h2>
            A treatise on the intricate Platonic epistemology of the classic 2007 Dreamworks production
        </h2>
        <p>
            It is a well-established fact of modern civilization, that true enlightenment cannot be attained until one has not just watched,
             but subsumed one's identity to "Bee Movie" in its entirety. This website aims to expound on this assumption, as it
             is often taken for granted. We tend to forget that before 2007, human civilization, if we can even call it that, had existed in the 
             state of sheer drudgery that was the pre-Bee Movie world for roughly 5 millenia. Accounts from that time are too
             graphic to describe here.

            Fortunately, those oppressive days are long behind us, but their spectre looms over all of us, threatening to return
             if we forget our duty of educating the youth, and indeed the ignorant of society in general. 
             It is for this reason that I present you with the following text. I cannot force you to do as I say, but 
             if you are a responsible human being, find it within yourself to <b>read this text</b>, 
             <i>cherish it, <u><b>absorb it into your being.</b></u></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Before that, however, I shall make an effort to explain why one should embark on this
             challenging journey, this... <i>pilgrimage of the mind</i>. These are some of the reasons, ranked in order(some without any particular order).
             <ol>
                 <li>yes</li>
                 <li>yes</li>
                 <li><ul><b>
                     <li>YES</li>
                     <li>YES</li>
                     <li>YES</li>
                    </b></ul></li>
                 <li>yes</li>
             </ol>

             That may have cleared some doubts, but to leave no stone unturned, I present a 
             table illustrating when and in which situation one should dedicate themselves to
              the cause.
             <!--	4x5 table containing random data, with row of header cells-->
             <table>
                 <tr>
                     <th>
                         Should
                     </th>
                     <th>
                         You
                     </th>
                     <th>
                         Read
                     </th>
                     <th>
                         The Text
                     </th>
                 </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                 </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                 </tr><tr>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                 </tr><tr>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                    <td>YES</td>
                 </tr>
             </table>
             <!--	2x2 table, with upper left cell containing an image, upper right - text,
                bottom row should contain a single cell with 2 column width,
                also containing text-->
            The following table further elucidates this point:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <img src="barry.jpeg" style="width:150px;height:150px;">
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Ok
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan="2"><b>YES</b></th>
                </tr>
            </table>
