        So I have to write this stupid diary thing for English. You know it’s stupid, Mrs. McKenzie, but you assigned it so you’ll have to read it. And for anybody else I’m supposed to explain the assignment in the first paragraph. Okay. I have to take a special English class because my grades are so bad. I have to write this diary or journal–she said to call it that if it’s easier to think of than a ‘diary’–and thank God for spell-check, I say! Anyway, at the end of every month we’re supposed to turn it in and by the end of the year we can look back and all that stuff. She said some of us will wait to the end of the month and try to put everything down, but it’s better to write a little as it happens. She said we’ll find out what works for us
        It’s my last year of junior high, thank God, and I can’t wait for tenth grade to roll around and high school! Only my grades are bad so I’ve got to clean things up. Yeah, for what? Another dead-end job like the one that killed my old man? Or Mom working long hours at the hospital for low pay? Land of Opportunity, sure …
        Okay, this is the end of September<span class="quote">&quot;this is<br> the end of&quot;</span>. I missed three days in the middle of the month. Got even farther behind. The classes all seem dumb to me; the only thing that makes it worth coming is looking at pretty girls. That’s honest, Mrs. McKenzie!
        </p>
        <p>
        Forgot something–I didn’t say my name. Even though it’s on the front of the paper, what the heck. As you know, Mrs. McKenzie, I’m Larry Hanson. There. Oh, and I’m supposed to put in ‘life stuff’. Well, Mom is still on my case about my long hair, my friends, and so what else is new? I’m lucky to have any friends at all. I’m the runt of the litter, as my old man used to say. No matter what I eat, even protein things, I stay small. So I have some friends who watch out for me. Yeah, maybe we get a little rowdy, but, hey, we’re guys, right?
        Like the suspension thing.<img src = "pic7.jpg" class = "wrappedImage"> A girl said some rude things to a friend of mine and we told her off. So now we’re the bad guys! If she hadn’t started dissing us nothing would have happened and how come she didn’t get suspended, too?
        Me getting suspended did not sit well with Mom. She usually leaves me alone, because she’s either working or too tired to fight, but she does take every chance to yell at me about my hair or my room or whatever. So she went ballistic after the suspension and said the school says I need some counseling. So we went to this therapist that helped her best friend stop smoking and another one lose weight. The hypnosis thing. And big deal, I got bored and went to sleep because she couldn’t hypnotize me. Just a waste of the school’s money and my time! Mom said we’ll try again every week until they get some progress. It’s not gonna happen. They can’t hypnotize me and I’m just getting some extra sleep. Waste of money.
        The one cool thing Mom did is make a deal with me. She said she’d get some CDs from my favorite bands, the real metal stuff, hardcore, as long as I went to the therapist. Easy deal! So I get to put on my phones and zone out–maxed out to eleven!–and an extra hour of sleep with the therapist. Like I said, easy deal.
        So that’s it for September.

        McKenzie said we could write a draft of this journal thing, and she said we can swear and say anything we want as long as it’s honest. Then clean it up and edit and all that stuff and turn it in. Mackie–he’s my best friend, along with Steve–said we’d fry her brain with what we’re really up to! So I thought it might be fun. To do the draft thing with the truth, and then make it all clean and lily-white for McKenzie.
        Then I thought, what the heck; why do all the editing and clean-up? I’ll just write Squeaky Clean for McKenzie and Down & Dirty for my own safekeeping. Truth Time. What the heck; it might be interesting to see how the truth of what happened changes over time!
        The suspension thing sucks big time. Mackie and Steve and me were just checking the babes out at lunch time, and this stuck-up bitch Celia Duran got pissed. We were hanging out at the edge of the school and Celia lives close, I guess, and was walking back from lunch. Mackie was going ‘Celia-feel-ya’ and Steve and me were cracking up. She stops and says something about Neanderthals and Steve says, ‘Shut up, you stupid bitch’ and she didn’t cry, which surprised me, but her face got hard. I’d seen that once before when Heather–one of the Heathers, the one that’s a cheerleader–said something to her and bumped her as she passed. Celia just turned and there was that hard face and I was ten feet away but when I saw that face I still went ‘Whoa!’
        So Celia stares down Steve and just said, “You guys are pathetic. Get a life,” or something like that and Mackie just said, “You’re pathetic. You just need a real man.” And she said, “What would you know about that?” and Steve had said something and Mackie had said something so I had to say something so I said, “You just need a good fucking and we’re the ones to give it to you.”
        Okay, I’ve never said anything <span class = "quote">&quot;like that but I&quot;</span>like that but I had to prove myself to the other guys, right? So maybe that was a little over the top, but she did these squinty eyes at me and her mouth worked like she’d swallowed something bad and just said, “Oh, Larry.” Then she walked away.
        Mackie turned to me and put his hand over his forehead and went “Oh, Larry!” and Steve said, “She’s such a bitch!” but I wondered what she meant by that, the way she said it. I felt really crappy for some reason.
        But Mrs. Olson the cafeteria lady was around the corner and heard us and so we got busted and nothing was done about Celia calling us names but we got suspended for three days.
        </p>
        <p>
        Mom was so pissed, like I’ve never heard her. She was going on and on about my old man and she’d hoped I was better than him and I yelled for her to stop talking about my old man like that, you stupid woman! I almost called her a bitch but stopped at the last moment. She raised her hand to slap me and I don’t know why but she just kind of deflated. Dodged that one!
        So the school said I had to do some ‘sensitivity counseling’ because I’d threatened Celia with gang-ape. Gang-ape? Geez! We were just talking, you know? Just screwing around. We were mad at her. Mom said the<span class = "quote">&quot;said the&quot;</span> counseling couldn’t hurt, so she began calling around. She found this new-age space cadet named Ms. Belasco, if you can believe that name. Plants all over the office, big weird paintings and sculpture things, and she was in this long dress thing like my grandmother wore called a moo-moo or something. Stupid name.
        I just lay on the couch and talked about myself but it was all as clean and lily-white as the stuff I write for McKenzie. Then I fell asleep. I think Mom and I got ripped off, which burns me, but she said the school required it so Belasco’s getting paid by them, I guess. We got some vitamins and a case of a fruit juice supplement. I’m taking the stuff every day and the juice isn’t bad. What the heck; vitamins can’t hurt. Maybe I’ll get bigger and stronger.
        </p>

        What I didn’t put in the McKenzie thing was about the CDs Mom got me. I mean, they’re really hardcore metal–way beyond those dinosaurs Metallica! The funny thing is, Mom’s a real straight arrow, never does anything wrong, but she got these bootlegs. I thought she’d go to the store and buy the individual CDs of the bands I asked for but she said they’re too expensive–got that right!–and has a friend that duplicates them. So like I said, she doesn’t mind me listening to them and they’re really great bands. The recording is a little fuzzy but not enough to bother me; I guess it’s part of the bootleg duping process. And I thought, she could afford one CD at the store, but she got ten of ‘em so a little fuzz in the mix can’t hurt! And cranked up, who the hell cares?   
        I’m doing better in school, I think. Maybe because I’m not spending as much time cutting classes. I started doing the homework because I have to turn it in anyway, because the school said I might not make The Bridge–that’s what they call going into high school–if I don’t make the effort. So it’s actually easier to just show up, listen, do the homework that night, turn it in the next day and forget about it.
        I’m getting along better with <img src="pic6.jpg" class = "wrappedImage">some of the other kids. A friend of mine knocked a girl’s books down by accident and I helped her pick them up. After that some kids seemed nicer to me. I guess it’s like making the effort for the schoolwork.
        Not a lot to report. No holidays until Halloween. My friends and me will do the usual, just kind of hang out and watch things. We don’t do costumes or anything.
        Halloween was cool. We just hung out, but we had a scare of our own when some older guys, out of high school, I think, chased us. But we got away and had a good laugh. We found a bag of candy that someone had dropped, too, so we had dessert!
        </p>
        <p>
        A very weird month. I’m getting so much shit from Mackie about doing my schoolwork, but I had this thought–what if he got busted? I mean, as long as it’s Mackie and Steve and me hanging out, that can go on forever. Who the hell cares about school? But he stole some stuff from a sporting goods store and got away with it, but if he’d gotten caught and went to juvie, I’d be stuck with Steve who is cool but let’s face it, not too bright. But with Mackie gone, what would I do? Nobody likes me. Yeah, I’m the runt of the litter, but hanging with Mackie is two-edged. It protects me from hassle, but nobody wants anything to do with me. Or us. So we just hang together.
        I guess that’s why I helped Leslie with her books. Mackie came up and said, “Outta my way, cunt” and she kind of screamed and Steve giggled at that. But she dropped her books she was so freaked, and I was last in line and I don’t know why but I picked up the books because Leslie was standing there shaking. She didn’t say anything but I saw Celia and some other kids looking at us. I got the squinty thing from Celia again. What the hell?
